The Vants! This project was fun! 
I always love little simulations that do their own thing. While reaction diffusion is satisfying, vants felt actively fun to watch. 
I wish I had more time to explore with tweakpane in this assignment, that being said, I am happy to have learned how the index state worked in this scenario. 
For the most part, I kept this assignment simple, but I also wanted to make sure that vants were unpredictable. For an example: I was curious what it would look like if one type of vant stayed in its own little circle. 
It was simple enough to implement, and the other vant’s had interesting behavior when they met up with this consistent vant type, but after a while, 
I realized that I didn’t like that one of the vants didn’t have unpredictable behavior. 

The original vants are yellow. They follow the original algorithm of turning left if there’s a pheromone, and right if there is not. 
On the other hand, the dark blue vants are the reverse. They will turn right if there’s a pheromone, and left if there is not. On their own, even just these two had interesting behaviors.
The red vants I dubbed as “nervous vants”. This was an experimental vant, in which I used a sin function in the case of a pheromone. 
If there is no pheromone, then the red behavior is a simple left turn. 
The high value for turning if there is a pheromone combined with the usual behavior made its movements sharp and erratic compared to the other vants. 
It makes a big mess, but it keeps things interesting. 
The purple vant, who I dubbed the “Ice-skater”, is my favorite visually. 
It’s a fraction of a turn, so it moves diagonally, and it moves in little loops. 
The diagonal movement makes it look lithe and quick to me. 
I love the way that the looping patterns mesh with the others.
It gives the vants’ pheromone art piece an elegant, almost filigreed look. 
It is fun to see what slight behaviors interact with one another, tweaking vants is something I could spend hours doing.
