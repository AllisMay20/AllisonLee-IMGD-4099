I was not able to complete Assignment 2 in full, unfortunately, but at this time I am worried that I am going to fall too far behind. The main technical issue that I faced in this assignment was more or less understanding all of the different “pages” of code that you can find in Glitch and how to organize these pages, as well as, of course, trying to figure out the syntax. While I was not able to complete this assignment in full, I am happy that I was at least able to figure out how to get the video up and running, make sure that it was full screen, and figure out how to include cellular noise over top of the video display. Aesthetically, I was also hoping to include a sort of interactive slider that added varying levels of feedback, adjusted color, and a slider that would scale the size of the cells. With even more time, I believe that it would be quite fun to learn how to make the video distort the user’s face. Unfortunately I had quite a few issues trying to get Tweakpane to work. Since Tweakpane will be used again in Assignment 3, I hope that I can learn it then, and be able to go back and fix up Assignment 2 once I have a better understanding of Tweakpane. 
	The aesthetic intent in this case was to hopefully make an exciting, interactive way to have the user play around with the textures caused by the cells in whichever way they like, especially if there was a way in which I could make the cells distort the person’s face, like they were looking underwater. Although I was not able to complete the assignment in full, I am glad that I was able to get more comfortable using the Glitch website and at least had success in implementing the cellular example from the Book of Shaders. Hopefully, I can return to this assignment with more confidence and shape it into the interactive video environment that I had envisioned.
